# NCL Service Delivery (WIP)

## About
Demo of basic Geopandas and Streamlit functions for mental health services across
North Central London. 

Add-ons/research avenues:
- Use of relevant demographic/choropleths (e.g. SEND population/MH crisis call figures)
- Travel time forecasts
- Service allocation analysis (Accessibility)
- New service planning
- Public transport networks
- More service detail (e.g. contact details, image, information, type of service)

Note - postcodes/addresses for some services pulled from LLMs and require verification
before concrete research.
